# Simple-Search-Engine-Data-Mining-project
In this project, we aim to design and implement a basic search engine for a collection of text documents. Its task is to take a query from the user and retrieve relevant documents for that query. We used the Vaswani dataset for this project. First, I performed preprocessing steps such as cleaning, removing stopwords, tokenization, and stemming. Then, I proceeded with indexing, where for each term, I maintained a list of document IDs where the term appears along with the frequency of occurrence. After that, I implemented steps for processing the incoming query, retrieving documents that contain all the terms from the query, and ranking the retrieved documents based on a ranking algorithm (TF-IDF). Following that, I performed query expansion for the incoming query using BERT. I created a simple user interface so that the user can enter the query in the search box and retrieve relevant documents. Finally, I conducted an evaluation of the search engine.
